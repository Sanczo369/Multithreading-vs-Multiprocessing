# Multithreading-vs-Multiprocessing
Multithreading and multiprocessing are two techniques allowing for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. Comparing the duration of the same tasks performed using both techniques can lead to interesting conclusions.

## Project Description
The project consists of two parts:
1. Program that checks the time taken to perform a certain task in one thread, multiple threads and multiple processes;
2. Report generated by this program.

Once the program is started, it should calculate the time taken to perform the following task five times in the following variants of threads and processes:
- one thread;
- four threads;
- four processes;
- processes, the number of which depends on the number of available processors in the system.
